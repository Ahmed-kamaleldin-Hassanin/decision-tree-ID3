# Decision-Tree-ID3
#### Implementation for ID3
There are variety of decision trees Algorithms ID3,CART,CHAID,C4.5....etc. 
### In this reposatory i will give a trial to implement ID3

#### How it works ? (Steps)

1)Starts at the root node. 
2)splits the data into groups. 
3)set a decision node.
4)Move the data along the respective branches.
5)Repeat the process until a stopping criterion is met.

#### How to choose the root node ?

For choosing the root node we will use:

1)Entropy.

2)Information Gain.

 ###### Functionality:
  Entropy : Quantifies the uncertainaty of chaos in the group.
  Information Gain : Measures the reduction or change in the entropy.
